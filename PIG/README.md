# ðŸŽ² Dice Game (Pig Style) in Python

This is a simple **multiplayer dice game** written in Python.
Each player takes turns rolling a die. The goal is to reach **15 points** first. But be carefulâ€”if you roll a `1`, your score resets to `0` for that round!

## ðŸ“– How the Game Works

1. The program asks how many players will play (**2â€“4 players allowed**).
2. Each player starts with `0` points.
3. On their turn, a player may **roll the dice**:
   - If they roll a number between `2â€“6`, that value is added to their total score.
   - If they roll a `1`, their score is reset to `0` for that turn, and their turn ends immediately.
4. A player can **choose to stop rolling** at any time and keep their current score.
5. The first player to reach **15 points** wins the game!
