# üêç Python Project-Based Learning

Welcome to the **Python Project-Based Learning Repository**!
This repo is a collection of hands-on Python projects designed to strengthen coding skills through **practical examples** instead of just theory.

Each project is stored in its own folder with clear code and a `README.md` (when needed).
